# Experimental Evaluation of Snort performance as packet sniffer/logger.

This repository contains an experimental evaluation project which aims to observe and measure the performance of Snort as a packet sniffer/logger when run on two virtual nodes with two different operating systems.

This work was done for the [Master's degree in Computer Science](https://www.informaticamagistrale.unifi.it/) at the [University of Florence](https://www.unifi.it/) as part of exam *B018966 - Analisi Quantitativa dei Sistemi (Quantitative Analysis of Systems)*.
