# Experimental evaluation of Snort performance as packet sniffer/logger

This repository contains an experimental evaluation project which aims to observe and measure the performance of Snort as a packet sniffer/logger when run on two virtual nodes with two different operating systems.

This project was done during the [Master's degree in Computer Science](https://www.informaticamagistrale.unifi.it/) at the [University of Florence (https://www.unifi.it/) as part of the exam *B018966 - Analisi Quantitativa dei Sistemi (Quantitative Analysis of Systems)*.

See https://github.com/FrancescoMucci/CS-theses-and-assignments for other projects and assignments done during the Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science.
